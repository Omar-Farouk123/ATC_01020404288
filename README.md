# Project Structure Guide

This repository contains a full-stack Event Booking application, organized as follows:

## Root Structure

- **FE/** â€” Frontend (React)
  - `my-app/` â€” Main React project
    - `src/` â€” Source code (components, pages, services, context)
    - `public/` â€” Static assets and HTML
    - `README.md` â€” Frontend usage and setup
- **BE/** â€” Backend (Spring Boot)
  - `src/` â€” Java source code and resources
    - `main/java/com/booking/` â€” Java packages (controllers, services, entities, etc.)
    - `main/resources/` â€” Config files (application.properties, data.sql)
  - `pom.xml` â€” Maven build config
  - `README.md` â€” Backend usage and setup
- **uploads/** â€” Uploaded images for users and events
  - `users/` â€” User profile images
  - `events/` â€” Event images

## How it Works
- The **frontend** (FE) is a React app for users and admins to interact with events and user management.
- The **backend** (BE) is a Spring Boot REST API that handles authentication, event management, user management, and file uploads.
- The **uploads** folder is used by the backend to store and serve images for users and events.
- Both FE and BE have their own README files for setup and usage instructions.
